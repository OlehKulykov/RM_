/**
Read only, immutable Data layer type, e.g. DAL functionality.

All DAL's operates with entities, thats why this DAL type use internal entity type for identify,
manage objects and next provide/cast to it's public type.

For instance: data model have user entity as `RM_User` and there is user type public protocol `RM_UserType`,
with the public getters, vars and functions.
And, `InternalType` will be `RM_User` and `PublicType` is `RM_UserType`.

- Note: Following OOP encapsulation, all internal functionality use `InternalType` and the result
provided as `PublicType`.

/**
Mutable DAL type. 

This type of the DAL's inherits all readable/immutable functionality
and extends with editing functionality.

The main difference is that, the `PublicType` is same as `InternalType` type.
Let's say, mutable DAL's operates with entity original type, like `RM_User` ( **NOT** public `RM_UserType` protocol ) and
inherited read functionality will return actual `InternalType` type of the entities.

With mutable DAL's you could modify CoreData entity properties, relationships, etc.
Use this DAL type for update/modify mada model.

- Note: All mutable methods doesn't save changes, thats why developer should call `save()` manualy after all operations/modifications are done.
